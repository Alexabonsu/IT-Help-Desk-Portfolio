## ⚡ ESD PRECAUTIONS AND OPENING OF COMPUTERS

**Electrostatic Discharge (ESD):**  
The sudden transfer of static electricity from your body or an object into a computer component.  
ESD can **damage sensitive parts** like the motherboard, RAM, or CPU.

### 🔒 How to Prevent ESD:
1. Wear an **anti-static wrist strap** connected to a grounded metal object.  
2. Store parts in **anti-static bags**.  
3. Work on **non-carpeted surfaces**.  
4. Touch a **grounded metal part** before handling components.  
5. Avoid **synthetic clothing** that generates static.  
6. Use an **ESD mat** when possible.

## 🧠 CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (CPU)

The **CPU** is the *brain of the computer*.  
I performed hands-on exercises to identify, remove, and reinstall the CPU.

### 🧰 Practice Done:
1. Unscrewed the **heat sink** and **fan** from the motherboard.  
2. Unclipped the **CPU** from its socket carefully (held by the edges).  
3. Cleaned off old **thermal paste**.  
4. Reinstalled the CPU and reattached the heat sink and fan.

### 🧩 CPU Socket Types:
| Socket Type | Brand | Description |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| **LGA (Land Grid Array)** | Intel | CPU pins are on the motherboard. |
| **PGA (Pin Grid Array)** | AMD | CPU has pins that fit into holes on the motherboard. |
| **BGA (Ball Grid Array)** | Mobile/Laptop | CPU is soldered directly to the motherboard. |

⚠️ **Important:** Always match the CPU to its correct socket type before installation.  
Incorrect pairing can damage both the CPU and motherboard.

## 🧮 RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (RAM)

**RAM** is the *short-term memory* of a computer.  
It stores data that the CPU needs to access quickly.

### 🧾 Details on RAM:
- Markings on RAM include: **DDR type (DDR3, DDR4)**, **bandwidth**, and **capacity (GB)**.  
- Use matching RAM (same brand, capacity, and speed) for best performance.  
- **DDR** means “Double Data Rate”; the number (e.g., DDR3) indicates the generation level.

### 🧰 Practice Done:
- Learned how to **safely remove** and **reinstall** RAM modules in the desktop.

---

## 💽 DRIVES (STORAGE)

Drives are used to **store data** — including the operating system, applications, and files.

### 🧰 Practice Done:
- Removed, installed, and upgraded desktop drives (HDDs and SSDs).  
- Identified connection interfaces (SATA and power connectors).

---

## ⚙️ POWER SUPPLY UNIT (PSU)

The **Power Supply Unit (PSU)** converts **AC (wall outlet power)** into **DC power** used by computer components.

### 🧰 Practice Done:
1. Identified the PSU inside the PC case.  
2. Learned that some PSUs are **preinstalled with the case**.  
3. Practiced how to **screw and unscrew** the PSU.  
4. Removed the **two main cables** connected to the power case and motherboard.

---

## 🎮 GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNIT (GPU)

The **GPU** handles all **graphics and visual rendering** on a computer.

### 🧰 Practice Done:
1. Located the GPU card in the **PCIe slot** on the motherboard.  
2. Unscrewed the **mounting screws**.  
3. Released the **PCIe latch**.  
4. Carefully **removed the GPU**.

---

## 🧩 MOTHERBOARD (MOBO)

The **motherboard** holds and connects all major computer components.  
It provides **interconnectivity** between the CPU, RAM, drives, and peripherals.

### 🧰 Practice Done:
1. Gained access to the motherboard by removing the case cover.  
2. Unplugged and labeled cables (noting manufacturer labels on the board).  
3. Removed cables one by one to avoid confusion.  
4. Unscrewed and removed the motherboard.

### 🧾 Before Purchasing a Motherboard:
1. Ensure it has the **correct socket type** for the CPU.  
2. Verify the **chipset compatibility** with your processor.  
3. If a cable doesn’t fit, double-check that it’s the **right port and orientation** — never force it.

## 🔌 PORTS, CABLES & PERIPHERALS

During practice, I identified various ports and connectors used in desktop computers.

| Connector | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **DB9** | Used for modems, routers, or PLCs. |
| **VGA** | For analog video display. |
| **DVI** | Digital replacement for VGA. |
| **DisplayPort (DP)** | Carries high-quality video and audio. |
| **USB Ports** | Universal connectors for peripherals. |
| **Mouse / Keyboard** | Input devices. |
| **RJ45 Port** | Ethernet port for network cables. |

## 🧪 POST AND BIOS

### 🧩 POST (Power-On Self-Test)
When a computer starts, it automatically runs a diagnostic test called **POST**.  
It checks that key hardware components work before loading the operating system.

**POST Checks Include:**
- CPU  
- RAM  
- GPU  
- Motherboard  
- Power supply  
- Keyboard and essential peripherals

### ⚙️ BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)
The **BIOS** is firmware that initializes hardware and loads the operating system.

🧠 **Note:** Accessing BIOS depends on the PC brand (common keys: **F2**, **DEL**, **ESC**, **F10**).

### 🧰 Support Response:

**Response to Ticket #456785 – Computer Won’t Power On**

Hello [User],  
Thank you for reaching out. Let’s go through some quick troubleshooting steps:

1. **Power Source Check** – Ensure the computer is securely plugged into a working outlet.  
   (If a laptop, confirm the charger is connected and the battery isn’t fully drained.)  
2. **Cable Reset** – Disconnect all cables and peripherals, then reconnect them firmly.  
3. **Indicator Lights / Sound Check** – Look for power lights, fan noise, or charging indicators.  
4. **Power Reset** – Hold the power button for **10–15 seconds**, release, then press again.

If the computer is still unresponsive, we may need to inspect the **power supply (desktop)** or **charger/battery (laptop)**.  
Please let us know the results for further assistance.

Best regards,
