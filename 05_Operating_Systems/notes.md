## OPERATING SYSTEM 101

An **Operating System (OS)** is the software that acts as a **middleman between the User, Hardware, and Applications**.

It provides a bridge that allows software programs to interact with computer hardware efficiently and securely.

## FUNCTIONS OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM

The operating system manages:

1. **Hardware** ‚Äì CPU, RAM, Disk drives, Input/Output devices, and Network cards.  
2. **Applications** ‚Äì Programs like Google Chrome, Microsoft Word, and antivirus tools.  
3. **Users** ‚Äì Human users, administrators, and service accounts.

## TYPES OF OPERATING SYSTEMS

1. **Windows Operating System**  
2. **Linux Operating System**  
3. **Mac Operating System**  
4. **Mobile Operating Systems** ‚Äì Android and iOS

## TWO MAIN WORLDS OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM

1. **User Space (Userland)**  
   - Where applications and software run.  
   - No direct access to the computer‚Äôs hardware.  

2. **Kernel**  
   - The core of the operating system.  
   - Manages hardware directly and provides controlled access for applications.

## FILE SYSTEMS

A **File System** is how an operating system organizes, stores, and retrieves data on storage devices.

It provides structure and a directory system so that data can be accessed quickly and efficiently.

### üß† Key Takeaways

- The OS ensures smooth communication between hardware, users, and software.  
- The kernel is the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of the OS ‚Äî managing all hardware operations.  
- File systems organize how data is stored and retrieved on drives.  
- Understanding user space and kernel space helps in troubleshooting and system management.
